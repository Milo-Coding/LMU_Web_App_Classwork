**App Description**

Our web app is a compound interest calculator that takes several inputs from the user to calculate their interest.

The app takes two inputs as text, the principle investment and the percentage interest rate, which it limits to numbers as other characters cannot be used in our interest formula.

The number of years is on a slider that ranges from 0 to 100 years, which we felt was a fitting range that you would need to calculate interest on an investment.

The number of times compounded per year is selectable from a drop-down menu of the most common intervals.

Finally, the user will press a button to calculate their interest and total value so they can review all their information first.
