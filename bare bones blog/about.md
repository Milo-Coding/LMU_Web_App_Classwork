# Pokemon Blog Description

**description:** <br>
This web app is a blog site that offers the user a place to log on and discuss pokemon with other users. <br>
All you need to make a post is a google account and a computer with internet access. <br> Once you get to the sight and log on you can start posting about ~~all of the~~ 20 amazing pokemon.

**new features:** <br>
1. Advanced Posting Options

The first of my three new features was a massive expansion of the blog posting and display menu. <br>
For starters, there is a new button, the cancel button, that allows the user to back out of creating thier post and return to the viewing menu. <br>
The time when the post was made is also avalible now in an easy to read, relative formate. <br>
You are also able to track which user has created each post on the site. <br>
To top it all off, there is a new item, a selection bar, in the create-a-post menu that allows the user to add a special tag to their post signifying which pokemon it is about.

2. Scrolling Pokemon Bar

The second, and perhaps most visually notable, feature is pokemon selct bar, a scrolling bar with sprites of all the pokemon up for discussion. <br>
These are the same 20 pokemon that you can choose from in the selection box when creating an article. <br>
By clicking on one or more of the pokemon, you can filter posts down to those tagged with the corrosponding pokemon.

3. Nav Menu Overhaul

The final of the three features for this blog app was an overhaul of the blog navegation menu. <br>
The scrolling menu has been shortend and broken apart into pages that can be viewed 10 articles at a time. <br>
just below the article selection field are some buttons to navigate the pages, one for progressing and one for returning to the front page. <br>
To top it off, the navegation menu, as well as the rest of the blog, got a complete makeover for its look to better embody the pokemon spirit
