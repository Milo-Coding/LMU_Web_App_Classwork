# A Blog Starter App

**a.k.a. Bare Bones Blog ðŸ¦´**

_Adapted from Dr. Ray Toalâ€™s original https://github.com/lmucs/blog-starter-app_

This is a trivial blog app, started with create-react-app.

This repo is designed for you to fork and extend with (1) better CSS and (2) a real back end, with authentication and a database.
