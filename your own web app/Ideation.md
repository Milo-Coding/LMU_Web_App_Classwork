**Phase 1 Audiences:** <br>
Me, students, bored people, roommates, tech companies, procrastinators

**Phase 2 Needs:** <br>
1. I need a way to present all my projects because many internships ask for a portfolio.
2. Students need a way to schedule events because their classes often cause time conflicts.
3. Students need study materials that help with specific courses and subjects.
4. Bored people need a way to entertain themselves because they are bored.
5. Bored people need something productive to do because they have free time that they could use productively.
6. Roommates need a way to manage responsibilities, especially housekeeping, because that is a common source of conflict.
7. Roommates need something that will help them coordinate meals because everyone having separate meals will lead to an overstuffed fridge.
8. Tech companies need a way to keep up to date with relevant news and developments that may impact their projects.
9. Tech companies need a way to assess potential applicants because they are often overwhelmed by them.
10. Procrastinators need a way to get motivated to finish their work because they often face deadline issues due to late starts.
