**Inspiration:** <br>

Largely inspired by stress from the recent CSO midterm, the study guide creation app "StudyBuddy" transforms how students will prepare for upcoming tests and exams. <br>
The main issue this app aims to tackle is the lack of preparedness students face when going into these exams.

**Possible solutions:** <br>

Popular alternatives include sites like Quizlet, which provide useful tools to help you study, but they only focus on memorization. <br>
To truly tackle this problem, students need an app that will not just reinforce what they have already learned but also expand upon that knowledge so they will know everything they need going into the test. <br>
What better way to handle both tasks for an ever-growing array of subjects than the power of AI.

**Final app idea:** <br>
In the true spirit of computer science: let the computer do it.
StudyBuddy is a web app that harnesses AI, particularly the GPT API, to create personalized study guides and materials for students.<br>
It aims to go beyond simple memorization tools and provide comprehensive, context-rich resources to enhance understanding of subjects.<br>
Users will enter a text prompt of their desired subject and any info they want to spesifically include in their guide. <br>
StuddyBuddy will then use the GPT API to create a specilized study guide for the student.
